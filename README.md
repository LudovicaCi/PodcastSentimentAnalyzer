# Data Mining and Machine Learning Project
# Podcast Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis for podcast reviews, utilizing classification techniques to categorize sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. The analysis is complemented by Streaming Analysis, enabling dynamic tracking of sentiment evolution over time to adapt the classifier accordingly.

## Objectives

1. **Sentiment Analysis:**
    - Implement classification techniques for precise sentiment labeling.
    - Evaluate and compare classifiers for optimal performance.

2. **Streaming Analysis:**
    - Dynamically monitor the evolution of sentiments towards podcasts.
    - Assess classifier adaptability to changing trends, allowing for retraining.
